							<br/>
							<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;">B. COOKIES</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>GlobalTradeConnect.com uses "cookies" on certain pages to help evaluate our web site flow; modify our services, content and promotions; and access registration information. Cookies from third party websites may be encountered via your access of GlobalTradeConnect.com.  GlobalTradeConnect.com does not control any third party websites.</p>

									The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.

							<br/>
							<br/>
							<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;">C. DOES GTC SHARE THE INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and will not sell it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries GlobalTradeConnect.com controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
							<p>
								<li>
									<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;"><i>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</i></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as GTC sellers, these businesses operate stores at GlobalTradeConnect.com or sell offerings to you at GlobalTradeConnect.com. In other cases, we may operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. We share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. 
								</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li>
									<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;"><i>Third-Party Service Providers:</i></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
								</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li>
									<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;"><i>Promotional Offers: </i></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of GlobalTradeConnect.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please inform us via writing. 
								</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li>
									<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;"><i>Business Transfers: </i></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy Notice (unless the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that GlobalTradeConnect.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
								</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li>
									<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;"><i>Protection of GlobalTradeConnect.com and Others: </i></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of GlobalTradeConnect.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. 
								</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li>
									<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;"><i>With Your Consent:</i></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
								</li>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;">D. SECURITY</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							<p><li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. </li></p>
							<p><li>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. </li></p>
							<p><li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. GlobalTradeConnect.com will not be liable for any damages caused as a result of anyone else with or without your permission conducting transactions using your User ID/password/personal information. Change your password immediately if you are aware of any compromise of your account.</li></p>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;">E. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS AND LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. For more information about third-party advertising at GlobalTradeConnect.com, including personalized or interest-based ads, please read our <a href="javascript:;">Interest-Based Ads</a> policy. </p>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;">F. INTEREST-BASED ADS POLICY</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>On both GlobalTradeConnect.com owned and operated sites and unaffiliated sites, GlobalTradeConnect.com displays interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our sites, content, or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as purchasing on our sites, visiting sites that contain GlobalTradeConnect.com content or ads, interacting with GlobalTradeConnect.com tools, or using our payment services. In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations). </p>
							<p>Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies (collectively, "cookies"). Cookies enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites and other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly. We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads. </p>
							<p>We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in Western Canada who bought or browsed for classical music). Also, some third-parties may provide us information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising. </p>
							<p>Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this Interest-Based Ads page. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. </p>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;">G. ADVERTISING PREFERENCES</strong>
							<br/><br/>
							<p>GlobalTradeConnect.com offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from GlobalTradeConnect.com. You will still see ads but they will not be personalized. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. </p>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<strong style="color: #4a90e2!important;">H. WHICH INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</strong>
							<br/><br/>
